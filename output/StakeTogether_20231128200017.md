# SenseSecurity **StakeTogether** Audit 

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **StakeTogether**

Stake Together is at the forefront of innovation, constantly striving to enhance the security and accessibility of the Ethereum network. In our pursuit of excellence, we have implemented Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) as a cornerstone of our protocol. In this article, we will delve into the significance of DVT and how it fundamentally improves the staking process, strengthening security and inclusivity for validators of all sizes.
